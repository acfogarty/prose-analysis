<p>In fully classical multiscale schemes, to which we restrict ourselves here, the boundaries between resolutions generally correspond to the boundaries between system components, i.e., the biomolecule of interest is modelled at one resolution, while the components of its environment, such as solvent, lipid membranes, and other biomolecules, are each modelled at one or more different resolutions. - <span style="color:#FF8000;">66 words</span></p>
<p>Second, while coarse-grained water and protein models are becoming ever more sophisticated, they suffer from a number of issues: a lack of transferability to different contexts or state points, the inability to simultaneously reproduce all structural and thermodynamic properties, and a dynamics which is accelerated compared to the corresponding atomistic model. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">57 words</span></p>
<p>The two levels of resolution are coupled via a force-interpolation scheme, in which the intermolecular force between the centres of mass of molecules  and  is given by
where FAAij is the interaction between atoms i and j using the atomistic force-field, FCG is the interaction between molecules  and  using the coarse-grained force-field, and  is a transition function varying smoothly and monotonically between 1 in the AA region and 0 in the CG region, and in the hybrid region taking the form. - <span style="color:#FF0000;">86 words</span></p>
<p>An alternative option would be to use a CG potential at the same pressure as the AA potential, for example, a potential from the iterative Boltzmann inversion procedure with pressure correction or a hard-sphere or ideal gas potential at the appropriate pressure, in which case it is necessary to check that the difference in compressibilities between the AA and CG models does not lead to a barrier to molecule exchange between regions. - <span style="color:#FF0000;">76 words</span></p>
<p>This excess heat must be removed using a local thermostat; however, coupling to a thermostat leads to a perturbation of system dynamics, and in general terms, in application to biomolecular systems, would perturb processes involving significant thermal changes such as ligand binding and enzymatic reactions. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">51 words</span></p>
<p>Rather, we point out that while certain types of water dynamics may be perturbed out to a long distance by the presence of the protein, this does not necessarily imply the inverse, i.e., that water at that distance plays a significant role in protein structure or dynamics. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">52 words</span></p>
<p>The difference between those studies and our approach here is that the water between a protein surface and an organic solvent interface is in a situation of extreme confinement, with greatly retarded water dynamics, and not directly relevant to the understanding of protein and hydration shell behaviour in bulk aqueous solution. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">54 words</span></p>
<p>In this paper, we have extended the AdResS methodology to biomolecular systems, demonstrating that for a fully atomistic globular protein with an atomistic hydration shell coupled to a coarse-grained particle reservoir and heat bath, the structural and dynamical properties of both the protein and the atomistic aqueous solvent are correctly reproduced. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">55 words</span></p>

<p>Typical length scales of relevance range from micrometre cells to chemical reactions on the scale of angstroms , while biophysical and biochemical processes <span style="color: red">cover</span> a time scale spectrum from fs bond vibrations to protein folding or macromolecular diffusion which may take place on the order of seconds or longer . </p>
<p>Large systems <span style="color: red">inevitably</span> pose sampling problems , and values extracted from molecular simulation are <span style="color: red">only</span> as good as the employed forcefield and the quality of the statistical sampling , a fact which becomes <span style="color: red">increasingly</span> important the longer the relevant time scales . </p>
<p>Of help <span style="color: red">here</span> can be a coarse-graining approach , in which certain degrees of freedom are eliminated in the model describing the system . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , sufficient detail must be retained in order to <span style="color: red">correctly</span> describe physical or chemical processes of interest , and in heterogeneous systems , this can lead to a multiresolution scheme in which different parts of the system are <span style="color: red">simultaneously</span> modelled at different levels of resolution . </p>
<p>In <span style="color: red">fully</span> classical multiscale schemes , to which we restrict ourselves <span style="color: red">here</span> , the boundaries between resolutions <span style="color: red">generally</span> correspond to the boundaries between system components , i.e. , the biomolecule of interest is modelled at one resolution , while the components of its environment , such as solvent , lipid membranes , and other biomolecules , are each modelled at one or more different resolutions . </p>
<p>The resolution of a given molecule <span style="color: red">then</span> <span style="color: red">generally</span> remains fixed for the entire duration of the simulation . </p>
<p>This approach <span style="color: red">commonly</span> involves an atomistic ( AA ) protein in an environment which is coarse-grained ( CG ) , implicit , or a combination of both . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Similarly</span> , one can describe <span style="color: red">as</span> multiscale an approach in which the biomolecule itself is coarse-grained , while the environment is at an <span style="color: red">even</span> lower resolution , i.e. , implicit solvent or continuum . </p>
<p>In a few pioneering works , the fixed boundary between resolutions may <span style="color: red">even</span> occur at a fixed place within a single biomolecule . </p>
<p>Such fixed-resolution multiscale schemes have <span style="color: red">successfully</span> been used to reach longer length- and time scales than <span style="color: red">previously</span> possible , providing insights into processes and phenomena including cellular crowding , protein folding , ligand binding , and structural dynamics of DNA-protein complexes . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , the degrees of freedom to be eliminated in such multiscale schemes must be <span style="color: red">carefully</span> chosen based on the particular system under consideration . </p>
<p>There are two main points to bear in mind <span style="color: red">here</span> . </p>
<p>First , particular processes of interest may depend on properties <span style="color: red">only</span> present in <span style="color: red">atomistically</span> resolved models . </p>
<p>Many biomolecular processes are known to depend on properties like the hydrogen-bonding ability of water , which <span style="color: red">rely</span> on specific chemical detail . </p>
<p>Second , while coarse-grained water and protein models are becoming <span style="color: red">ever</span> more sophisticated , they suffer from a number of issues : a lack of transferability to different contexts or state points , the inability to <span style="color: red">simultaneously</span> reproduce all structural and thermodynamic properties , and a dynamics which is accelerated compared to the corresponding atomistic model . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Specifically</span> , in the case of a biomolecule in aqueous solution , it becomes desirable to be able to simulate the biomolecule and hydration shell <span style="color: red">atomistically</span> , <span style="color: red">yet</span> with the remainder of the solvent modelled at a coarse-grained level for computational efficiency . </p>
<p>Such an approach involves particles whose resolution is <span style="color: red">not</span> fixed but <span style="color: red">rather</span> depends on each particles instantaneous location in predefined atomistic or coarse-grained regions . </p>
<p>The Adaptive Resolution Scheme ( AdResS ) methodology has <span style="color: red">already</span> <span style="color: red">successfully</span> been used to simulate bulk water and a protein in a bundled water model . </p>
<p>The first study combining the adaptive resolution approach and biomolecular simulation showed that an atomistic protein can <span style="color: red">successfully</span> be simulated in adaptive resolution water , with the protein remaining <span style="color: red">stably</span> folded in ns-length simulations . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , the bundled water model used in that study did <span style="color: red">not</span> allow for an exploration of how protein and water dynamics compared to that observed in experiment and in standard atomistic simulations . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Here</span> , we simulate a <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic , 9-kDa protein , solvated in adaptive resolution water such that the hydration shell of the protein is <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic . </p>
<p>We <span style="color: red">first</span> validate our approach , via a detailed comparison of protein and water structure and dynamics to a <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic reference simulation , <span style="color: red">wherever</span> possible referring <span style="color: red">also</span> to experimental results . </p>
<p>In the final part of this paper , <span style="color: red">therefore</span> , we present one example of this , demonstrating how our methodology can be used to provide <span style="color: red">otherwise</span> inaccessible insight into the level of hydration necessary for protein function . </p>
<p>IV and V , we present a comparison of protein and water structure and dynamics to <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic reference simulations . </p>
<p>To model a <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic protein in AdResS water , the atomistic region is defined <span style="color: red">as</span> a sphere of radius dat centred on a point rcentre within the protein , with dat greater than the radius of gyration of the protein . </p>
<p>During a simulation , this atomistic region therefore moves with the <span style="color: red">freely</span> diffusing protein . </p>
<p>A solvent particle 's instantaneous identity depends on its spatial location within these regions , and particles can move <span style="color: red">freely</span> between regions . </p>
<p>In the atomistic region , the system is described in full atomistic detail ; in the case of a biomolecular simulation , this would <span style="color: red">typically</span> be pre-existing standard atomistic protein or DNA forcefields and water models . </p>
<p>The coarse-grained reservoir of water molecules can be described with any suitable CG potential , or <span style="color: red">even</span> by hard spheres or an ideal gas at the appropriate density or pressure . </p>
<p>The two levels of resolution are coupled via a force-interpolation scheme , in which the intermolecular force between the centres of mass of molecules and is given by where FAAij is the interaction between atoms i and j using the atomistic force-field , FCG is the interaction between molecules and using the coarse-grained force-field , and is a transition function varying <span style="color: red">smoothly</span> and <span style="color: red">monotonically</span> between 1 in the AA region and 0 in the CG region , and in the hybrid region taking the form . </p>
<p>The interaction between two atomistic or two coarse-grained molecules therefore simplifies to FAA or FCG , <span style="color: red">respectively</span> . </p>
<p>Note that since , in general , the interaction between the atomistic protein and the coarse-grained water will <span style="color: red">not</span> be parametrised , the values of dat , dhy , and the non-bonded interaction cutoff should be chosen such that there is no interaction between these system components . </p>
<p>The thermodynamic inconsistency issues inherent in structure-based coarse-graining have been <span style="color: red">extensively</span> discussed . </p>
<p>In particular , the CG potential which <span style="color: red">correctly</span> reproduces the AA pair distribution function will in general have a different pressure than the reference AA potential . </p>
<p>Using such a pair of CG and AA potentials <span style="color: red">together</span> in the AdResS setup would <span style="color: red">then</span> lead to a density difference between AA and CG regions . </p>
<p>To compensate for this , one can use an external force known as the thermodynamic force , which is obtained <span style="color: red">iteratively</span> via an expression based on the gradient of the density difference between atomistic and coarse-grained regions . </p>
<p>An alternative option would be to use a CG potential at the same pressure as the AA potential , for example , a potential from the iterative Boltzmann inversion procedure with pressure correction or a hard-sphere or ideal gas potential at the appropriate pressure , in which case it is necessary to check that the difference in compressibilities between the AA and CG models does <span style="color: red">not</span> lead to a barrier to molecule exchange between regions . </p>
<p>The coupling of models at different levels of resolution via Equation ( 1 ) leads to heat production in the hybrid region , due to the non-conservative nature of the interactions <span style="color: red">there</span> . </p>
<p>This excess heat must be removed using a local thermostat ; <span style="color: red">however</span> , coupling to a thermostat leads to a perturbation of system dynamics , and in general terms , in application to biomolecular systems , would perturb processes involving significant thermal changes such as ligand binding and enzymatic reactions . </p>
<p>We therefore thermalise <span style="color: red">only</span> the particles in the hybrid and CG regions , <span style="color: red">so</span> that these regions function as a thermal bath in which the <span style="color: red">biologically</span> relevant region is immersed . </p>
<p>Another option would be to employ an energy interpolation scheme <span style="color: red">instead</span> of the force-based interpolation ( Equation ( 1 ) ) used <span style="color: red">here</span> . </p>
<p>Such an energy-based scheme allows one to perform energy-conserving microcanonical ( i.e. , non-thermostatted ) simulations ; <span style="color: red">however</span> , such schemes <span style="color: red">also</span> have a higher computational cost , and the obtention of the necessary thermodynamic compensation functions may be less straightforward . </p>
<p>In this section , we have introduced several different factors which could a priori perturb system properties relative to those of a <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic system . </p>
<p>Both static and dynamic properties may be disrupted by the use of interpolated forces and coarse-grained forces in the HY and CG regions , <span style="color: red">respectively</span> , and by the thermodynamic force , applied <span style="color: red">only</span> in the HY region . </p>
<p>The thermostat applied in the HY and CG regions may perturb dynamics properties , as is of course the case for any thermostatted simulation , whether multiscale or <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic . </p>
<p>In this work , our aim is the <span style="color: red">quantitatively</span> correct modelling of physical behaviour in the AA region , while the HY and CG regions serve as a particle reservoir and heat bath . </p>
<p>None of the above-mentioned perturbative factors acts <span style="color: red">directly</span> in the AA region . </p>
<p>Their indirect effect is felt in the AA region <span style="color: red">only</span> in the immediate vicinity of the AA/HY interface , an effect which <span style="color: red">quickly</span> becomes negligible with increasing size of the AA region , as we explore and quantify in Sec . </p>
<p>Beyond this , particles in the AA region remain unperturbed by the above-mentioned factors , as has <span style="color: red">previously</span> been shown for a range of structural and diffusion properties , and as we will show in this work for additional static and dynamic properties . </p>
<p>One can define the hydration shell of a biomolecule as those water molecules <span style="color: red">structurally</span> or , more <span style="color: red">often</span> , <span style="color: red">dynamically</span> perturbed by the proximity of the biomolecule . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , the spatial extent of this perturbation remains controversial , with experimental and computational determinations ranging from a few angstroms to several hydration shells or up to 20 A from the protein surface . </p>
<p>In the case of multiscale simulation , this translates to the minimum number of <span style="color: red">explicitly</span> modelled water molecules needed . </p>
<p>Note that the discussion <span style="color: red">here</span> focuses on proteins in dilute ( mM ) solutions as found in many experiments and industrial applications , and <span style="color: red">not</span> on proteins under the conditions of macromolecular crowding found in cells . </p>
<p>The natural environment of proteins is <span style="color: red">evidently</span> aqueous solution , and the importance of including solvent effects in biomolecular simulation has <span style="color: red">long</span> been known . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Similarly</span> , atomistic proteins simulated in coarse-grained solvent show some of these problems , when the CG solvent model used is unable to supply all of the water properties necessary for correct protein behaviour . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Here</span> , we are interested in ubiquitin as a model for globular proteins in general , including enzymes . </p>
<p>As an indicator of protein structure , we use the number of intra-protein hydrogen bonds , relative to the number in <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic simulations ( i.e. , a <span style="color: red">fully</span> hydrated protein ) . </p>
<p>To probe protein dynamics , we use the error in the RMSF along the protein backbone , relative to the RMSF in the <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic system . </p>
<p>This is defined <span style="color: red">as</span> where xi , A is the RMSF for residue i in the <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic system , xi , S is the corresponding value in AdResS system S , and the sum is over all N residues . </p>
<p>The deviation from the behaviour displayed by <span style="color: red">fully</span> hydrated proteins occurs at a <span style="color: red">surprisingly</span> low hydration level . </p>
<p>At dat = 2 nm , where some parts of the protein have <span style="color: red">only</span> one layer of atomistic water , the protein <span style="color: red">still</span> behaves as though it were solvated in <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic solution . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , this should <span style="color: red">not</span> be interpreted as a claim that the optimum protein simulation system includes <span style="color: red">so</span> few water molecules . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Rather</span> , we point out that while certain types of water dynamics may be perturbed out to a long distance by the presence of the protein , this does <span style="color: red">not</span> <span style="color: red">necessarily</span> <span style="color: red">imply</span> the inverse , i.e. , that water at that distance plays a significant role in protein structure or dynamics . </p>
<p>It is of course important to bear in mind that the values presented <span style="color: red">here</span> are measures of protein behaviour , <span style="color: red">not</span> protein function , and that accurate reproduction of these measures is necessary but <span style="color: red">not</span> <span style="color: red">necessarily</span> sufficient for correct protein function . </p>
<p>In an aside , we note <span style="color: red">here</span> that a related topic is the use of proteins , <span style="color: red">specifically</span> enzymes , in organic solvent , an expanding field of research and industrial application . </p>
<p>Enzymes can function in organic solvent , albeit with <span style="color: red">greatly</span> reduced efficiency , and the catalytic activity may be correlated to the amount of trace water present in the system . </p>
<p>The behaviour of proteins simulated in pure non-polar organic solvents may be compared to that in many CG forcefields , with similar ideas of insufficient screening or lack of hydrogen bonding ability leading to altered enzyme properties and <span style="color: red">therefore</span> reduced activity . </p>
<p>The difference between those studies and our approach <span style="color: red">here</span> is that the water between a protein surface and an organic solvent interface is in a situation of extreme confinement , with <span style="color: red">greatly</span> retarded water dynamics , and <span style="color: red">not</span> <span style="color: red">directly</span> relevant to the understanding of protein and hydration shell behaviour in bulk aqueous solution . </p>
<p>We note <span style="color: red">also</span> that there exists a set of simulation methodologies that use a thin layer of explicit atomistic water molecules to model protein hydration , <span style="color: red">generally</span> with the aim of obtaining greater computational efficiency . </p>
<p>In order to prevent evaporation in such simulations , some sort of restraining force is <span style="color: red">typically</span> applied to keep water near the protein surface . </p>
<p>The bulk solvent may be <span style="color: red">entirely</span> absent or may be included in a mean field way . </p>
<p>Such methodologies <span style="color: red">naturally</span> provide an improvement in protein structural and dynamical properties over the gas phase and could <span style="color: red">also</span> be used to study the impact of the size of the explicit hydration shell . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , they are lacking the free particle exchange with bulk water provided by the AdResS methodology and the corresponding exact reproduction of water properties . </p>
<p>The solid red line shows the bulk reorientation time in the <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic simulations , and the dashed red lines are the corresponding error bars . </p>
<p>In the AA region ( left of figure ) , the reorientation time of course corresponds to that in bulk atomistic reference simulations , as <span style="color: red">already</span> demonstrated above . </p>
<p>Crossing the HY region from the AA to the CG side , reorientational dynamics <span style="color: red">then</span> speeds up <span style="color: red">as</span> the water-water interaction potential becomes more isotropic with decreasing value and the transformation of AA into CG water . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Indeed</span> , the defined orientation axis used to calculate the correlation function becomes less and less meaningful . </p>
<p>In this paper , we have extended the AdResS methodology to biomolecular systems , demonstrating that for a <span style="color: red">fully</span> atomistic globular protein with an atomistic hydration shell coupled to a coarse-grained particle reservoir and heat bath , the structural and dynamical properties of both the protein and the atomistic aqueous solvent are <span style="color: red">correctly</span> reproduced . </p>
<p>We have <span style="color: red">also</span> determined the minimum possible size of the atomistic region in such a simulation setup . </p>
<p>For the systems studied <span style="color: red">here</span> , our current implementation of the AdResS methodology provides a speedup of 1.6 2.2 , depending on the size of the atomistic region . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">However</span> , it is important to stress that the primary interest of the method is <span style="color: red">not</span> <span style="color: red">merely</span> computational speedup , but <span style="color: red">also</span> the possibility of gaining new physical insight by performing simulations which would otherwise be unfeasible for reasons other than <span style="color: red">simply</span> the limitations of computational resources . </p>
<p>We presented <span style="color: red">here</span> one example of such an application , demonstrating how our methodology can provide insight into the hydration level at which protein behaviour begins to break down . </p>
<p>We showed that , <span style="color: red">unexpectedly</span> , the structure and dynamics of a globular protein are <span style="color: red">correctly</span> reproduced <span style="color: red">even</span> with <span style="color: red">only</span> a handful of hydration shells . </p>
<p><span style="color: red">Further</span> possible extensions to the work presented <span style="color: red">here</span> include the study of energetic or thermodynamic properties and the implementation of an atomistic region which follows the shape of the biomolecular surface or changes in size as a function of the biomolecules conformation . </p>
<p>One can imagine simulation setups involving <span style="color: red">not</span> <span style="color: red">only</span> adaptive resolution solvent but <span style="color: red">also</span> mixed , adaptive resolution biomolecules . </p>
