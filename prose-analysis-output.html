<p>In fully classical multiscale schemes, to which we restrict ourselves here, the boundaries between resolutions generally correspond to the boundaries between system components, i.e., the biomolecule of interest is modelled at one resolution, while the components of its environment, such as solvent, lipid membranes, and other biomolecules, are each modelled at one or more different resolutions. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">66 words</span></p>
<p>Second, while coarse-grained water and protein models are becoming ever more sophisticated, they suffer from a number of issues: a lack of transferability to different contexts or state points, the inability to simultaneously reproduce all structural and thermodynamic properties, and a dynamics which is accelerated compared to the corresponding atomistic model. - <span style="color:#FFBF00;">57 words</span></p>
<p>The two levels of resolution are coupled via a force-interpolation scheme, in which the intermolecular force between the centres of mass of molecules  and  is given by
where FAAij is the interaction between atoms i and j using the atomistic force-field, FCG is the interaction between molecules  and  using the coarse-grained force-field, and  is a transition function varying smoothly and monotonically between 1 in the AA region and 0 in the CG region, and in the hybrid region taking the form. - <span style="color:#FF0000;">86 words</span></p>
<p>An alternative option would be to use a CG potential at the same pressure as the AA potential, for example, a potential from the iterative Boltzmann inversion procedure with pressure correction or a hard-sphere or ideal gas potential at the appropriate pressure, in which case it is necessary to check that the difference in compressibilities between the AA and CG models does not lead to a barrier to molecule exchange between regions. - <span style="color:#FF8000;">76 words</span></p>
