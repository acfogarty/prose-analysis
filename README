TODO:
- nicer printing of frequencies compared to a corpus
- US/UK spelling consistency
- fix spacing in adverb sentence printing
- make model mapping spelling to pronunciation, detect words which are similar in pronunciation and close together on page
- suggest alternative words (GloVe)
- better cleaning of special charactesr (inc. markdown or html tags)
